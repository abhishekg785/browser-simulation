#Simulation in Browser

##What i am doing ?
My universe will consist of three main components , System , World and Item.<br/>
I will be doing things a little bit procedurally, we will be repeating two steps in a loop,
First we run a step function that calculates the change in our objects properties, Second we translate
those changes into style properties and render a new frame.<br/>
if we manage to do it fast , we hope to create a beautiful natural looking simulation :)
